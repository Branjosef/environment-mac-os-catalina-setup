# Mac OSX Manual Environment Set Up

## Introduction

This Readme is a step-by-step guide for how to set up your local environment
**on a Mac**. Please note that these instructions will not work for non-Mac
users.

The following instructions are for macOS Catalina. If you are not on Catalina
but can upgrade, we recommend doing so before continuing.

If you are unable to upgrade to Catalina, additional instructions are included
in the steps below.

## When to Move to a Local Environment

For students online, INSERT WHAT TO DO

For students taking the in-person course, you should move to a local environment
at the start of the course, just after the Prework.

### Step 0

First, if you've downloaded the Learn IDE, you will need to uninstall it. For
detailed instructions on how to properly uninstall the IDE, please read this
[Help Center article][uninstall IDE].

### Step 1 - Run Automatic Install Script

Open up your Terminal. The terminal is where we are going to be doing most of our
installation steps! On Mac, you can open up your terminal by going to
Applications > Utilities > Terminal, or by using the quick launch (cmd + space)
and just start typing “Terminal”.

For convenience, we've written a script that will handle many installation
steps for us. In your terminal, run the following:

```sh
curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/flatiron-manual-setup-validator/master/automatic-install.sh | bash 2> /dev/null
```

Many tools will be downloaded and installed so this may take some time. During
the installation, you will be prompted to install XCode Command Line Tools.
Agree and allow the install to continue. You may also need to enter your
computer password in a couple of times.

At the end, if there are no errors, you should see a message indicating the
installation is complete as well as a few additional steps to take.

```sh
##########################
# INSTALLATIONS COMPLETE #
##########################
```

If you do not see this message, an error may have occurred during installation.
In this case, follow the step-by-step guide below for manually installing the
necessary tools.

> **Note:** If you are using a mac that is not on Catalina, you will need to 
> restart terminal to beging using Zsh instead of Bash.

### Step 2 - Configure Git

Git has been installed but still needs to be configured with your personal
account information. First, run the following to add your GitHub account name:

```sh
git config --global user.name <YOUR USERNAME>
```

Replacing `<YOUR USERNAME>` with your actual account username. We also want
to add the email account associated with your account. Run the command below to do so:

```sh
git config --global user.email <YOUR EMAIL>
```

You can verify these have been saved by running the same commands without
providing your information:

```sh
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

This information is used when you send code from your local machine to
GitHub.

### Step 3 - Add Your SSH Key to GitHub

Currently, if you were to send code to GitHub (commonly referred to as
'pushing'), you would be prompted to enter your credentials. To avoid having to
enter this information every time, you can add an SSH key from your computer to
GitHub as an alternative way to verify who you are. To see your SSH key, run the
following command:

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Go to https://github.com, sign in, and navigate to SSH and GPG keys in Settings.
Create a new SSH key and copy and paste your SSH key in.

## Step 4 - Configure the Learn Gem

Now we need to set up the Learn gem. Type the following into your terminal:

```sh
learn whoami
```

This will prompt you to set up the Learn gem.

> **Note:** When the gem asks you to go to `learn.co/your-github-username`, you
> must fill your username into the URL and be logged in to be able to retrieve
> your token.

### Step 5 - Get a Text Editor

Get a Text Editor. We suggest [Visual Studio Code][VS Code]; follow the link to
download the macOS version.

After downloading and unzipping, make sure to move the Visual Studio Code app
from your Downloads folder to your Applications folder. Open Finder and navigate
to Downloads (or wherever you save downloads). If you see Visual Studio Code
there, make sure to drag it over to Applications.

Once Visual Studio Code is in your Applications folder, launch the program and
type `⇧⌘P`, and your **Command Palette** will open. In your **Command Palette**,
type `>shell command`. Select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"

Next, let's install Visual Studio Code as your default text editor in the
`.learn-config` file. First, open the config file for Learn in a text editor (Let's
give Visual Studio Code a try!). If you successfully installed Visual Studio
Code and its shell commands, type `code ~/.learn-config` in your terminal. Your
`.learn-config` file should open in VSCode!

Change default editor from `subl` (or `atom`) to `code`. If you have a different
editor you prefer, you can set it as the default Learn editor in this file.

You can also set the default location where Learn will save all your labs. By
default, the Learn directory is set to  ~/Development/code.

Save and close the `~/.learn-config` file.

> **Note:** These settings only trigger when you use the 'Open' button in Learn
> or when you use the `learn open` command. You can always manually clone your
> labs to any location you wish and open them with any text editor without
> having to edit this config file.

### Step 6 - Install Support Programs

#### Install Chrome

Install [Google Chrome][] and [make Chrome your default browser][default chrome].

#### Install Slack

Install Slack for Mac and enable desktop notifications for Slack. One week
before your start date, you will receive an invitation to join the Flatiron
School workspace, `flatiron-school.slack.com`. You’ll also receive a welcome
email with information about channels you should join.

### Step 7 - Verify Installations

To verify that you've got everything installed, run the following command in
your terminal:

```sh
curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/flatiron-manual-setup-validator/master/manual-setup-check.sh | bash 2> /dev/null
```

This script will verify that everything you need is installed. If all checks pass,
you have completed the setup process and can move on!

> **Note** If there are any failed checks, use the manual install instructions
> below to install everything one at a time.

---

## Step By Step Instructions for Manual Installation

The instructions below are provided if the automatic install script
fails or you would prefer to manually step through the process. Some
steps above are repeated in the instructions below.

### Install XCode Command Line Tools

To install the XCode Command Line Tools, in the terminal, type:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

You will be prompted to accept a license agreement. You do not need to install
the entire Xcode application, just the command line tools.

If you get a message that the command line tools are already installed, that is
fine. We won't directly use these tools in the program, but they are used by other
tools we're about to install.

### Install Homebrew

Install the Homebrew package manager. You can do this by entering the following
command into your terminal

```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

> **Note:** this is all one line in the terminal (even if it is broken up into
> two lines here in your browser).

### Install Git

Git generally comes pre-installed with most operating systems, but you can check
by running `git version` in the terminal. If this gives you an error or does not
come back with a version number, you'll need to install Git. you can get using
Homebrew:

```sh
brew install git
```

### Install Support Libraries

Next we need to add a few support libraries:

```sh
brew install gmp
```

and

```sh
brew install gnupg
```

> **Note:** If you get the following error: Warning: gnupg-1.4.19 already
> installed, it's just not linked, run:

```sh
brew link gnupg
```

## Install Zsh (For Older macOS Versions)

If you are on macOS Catalina, Zsh is already installed and you can move on to
installing the Ruby Version Manager. If you are using an older macOS version and
are unable to upgrade, you can still install Zsh by running the following:

```sh
brew install zsh
```

Once installed, you'll need to set Zsh as your default shell. You can do this
by running:

```sh
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

### Install Ruby Version Manager

RVM is a tool that lets you run different versions of Ruby on your computer. If
one project you're working on works with Ruby version 2.3.3 and another needs
2.6.1, you can easily switch between the two versions when you switch between
projects. You can install RVM and set it up with the following commands:

* Run `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`(make sure you do not use sudo)
* Run `source ~/.zprofile` (This reloads your terminal configuration file - similar to closing your terminal and opening it again)*
* Run `rvm install 2.6.1`
* Run `rvm use 2.6.1 --default`
* Check that everything worked by running `ruby -v`. This should output the version of ruby you’re using (2.6.1)

If you want to see the list of versions that rvm has installed, you can run `rvm list`

### Install Some Ruby Gems

Ruby gems are pre-written, stand-alone, chunks of code that have been made
easily accessible to you. We'll use a lot of them soon, but for now, we should
get a few important ones.

* First, let's update our system gems by running `gem update --system`
* Next, install the Learn gems. Do this by running `gem install learn-co`
* Install the Bundler gem. This gem takes care of installing other gems you need
  for projects: `gem install bundler`
* Install Nokogiri with `gem install nokogiri` - Nokogiri is a gem to help parse
  HTML - useful when we want to scrape websites. If you encounter any errors
  while installing it, [check out the Nokogiri support docs][nokogiri support]
  for Mac OSX.

### Set Up the Learn gem

Now we need to set up the Learn gem. Type the following into your terminal:

```sh
learn whoami
```

This will prompt you to set up the Learn gem.

Note: When the gem asks you to go to learn.co/your-github-username, you must
fill your username into the URL and be logged in to be able to retrieve your
token. At the bottom of the your learn.co user page is an OAuth token. Paste
this token into the terminal when prompted to connect the Learn gem with your
account.

### Get a Text Editor

Modern text editors come with features that can be very helpful when starting
out as a programmer. We suggest [Visual Studio Code][VSCode]; follow the link to
download the macOS version.

After downloading and unzipping, make sure to move the Visual Studio Code app
from your Downloads folder to your Applications folder. Open finder and navigate
to Downloads (or wherever you save downloads). If you see Visual Studio Code
there, make sure to drag it over to Applications.

Once Visual Studio Code is in your Applications folder, launch the program and
type ⇧⌘P. Your Command Palette will open. In your Command Palette type  `>shell`
and select the option **"Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"**. This
will allow you to use the `code` command in your terminal to open files in VS
Code.

Next, let's install Visual Studio Code as your default text editor in the
learn-config file. First, open the config file for Learn in a text editor (Let's
give Visual Studio Code a try!). If you successfully installed Visual Studio
Code and its shell commands, type `code ~/.learn-config` in your terminal. Your
`.learn-config` file should open in VSCode!

With the `.learn-config` file open, we can make a small change. Change default
editor from `subl` (or whatever it may be) to `code`. 

> **Note:** [Atom][atom] is also a popular editor option. If you would prefer to
> use Atom over VS Code, you can. Just make sure that the `~/.learn-config` file
> has the correct editor. For VS Code, the file should include `:editor: code`,
> but for Atom users, this line should read: `:editor: atom`. If you have a
> different editor you prefer, you can set also it as the default learn editor
> in this file.

In `.learn-config`, you can also set the default location where Learn will save
all your labs. By default, the learn_directory is set to `~/Development/code`.
Save and close the  ~/.learn-config file.

> **Note:** These settings only trigger when you use the 'Open' button in Learn
> or when you use the learn open command. You can always manually clone your
> labs to any location you wish and open them with any text editor without
> having to edit this config file.

### Install SQLite

You’ll be using a couple of different databases as you move through the web
development track. The default database that Rails uses is SQLite. We also
frequently see that students want to deploy their apps to the free hosting
service Heroku. To do this though, you’ll need to be using Postgres instead.
It’s best if we just install both of them now so you can use either one.

To set up SQLite, run

```sh
brew install sqlite
```

### Install Rails

Finally, Rails! The powerful Ruby web framework. We can install it with

```sh
gem install rails
```

### Install Node

Later on in the program, we'll want to run JavaScript just like we run ruby. On
the command line, the program that runs JavaScript files (the 'JavaScript
Runtime') is called Node.

To manage different versions of Node installed on our computer, we can use
javascript's equivalent of RVM - NVM. Let's get your node version manager
installed. Run the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
```

Make sure you do not use `sudo`.

Next, run the following three commands:

```sh
echo 'export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"' >> ~/.zprofile
echo '[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile
```

This sets NVM up to be accessible in your terminal. The last command refreshes
your shell so you won’t have to quit terminal and open it again.

Finally, run the three following commands to install the latest version of Node:

```sh
nvm install node
nvm use node
nvm alias default node
```

### Install Chrome

Install Google Chrome and make Chrome your default browser. 

### Dotfiles

Configuration files are often prefixed with the '.' character, hiding them from
normal file explorer views - hence 'dotfiles'. Since the default configuration
of many of the tools we use is somewhat plain, it's helpful to add some
configuration on top.

These changes are optional, but recommended as they set up a variety of
convenient and ergonomic features to some of the most common tools you'll use -
irb , git , and zsh.

> **Note** If you ran the automatic install script earlier, your original
> dotfiles are saved as their filenames plus `.bac` at the end and there is no
> need to back the files as second time.

If you did not run the automatic install script, you'll first want to back up your
dotfiles before overwriting them. Run the following commands to do so:

```sh
mv ~/.irbrc{,.bak}
mv ~/.gitignore{,.bak}
mv ~/.zprofile{,.bak} 
mv ~/.gitconfig{,.bak}
```

> **Note:** If when you’re trying to back up a file, you get the error No such
> file or directory , don’t worry. This just means you didn’t have that file to
> start with, so there is nothing to back up.

#### IRB

To add some additional formating to IRB, run:

```sh
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/dotfiles/master/irbrc" -o "$HOME/.irbrc"
```

#### Global List of Files for Git to Ignore

When code is sent from your local machine to GitHub, it is possible to
accidentally send files that aren't normally meant to be sent. To avoid this,
many Git repositories contain a `.gitignore` file, defining what files should be
ignored when code is being pushed to GitHub. We can also set a global `.gitignore`
file to use for all repositories.

GitHub maintains [a list of files they recommend][octocat gitignore]. These filenames and 
a few others can be added to your own global `.gitignore` file by running:

```sh
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/dotfiles/master/ubuntu-gitignore" -o "$HOME/.gitignore"
```

#### Helpful Zsh Profile Shortcuts

Your Zsh profile loads up every time you open a terminal window. Learn has a default
`.zprofile` that is designed to load up a bunch of shortcuts for you as well as make
sure that RVM loads up every time you open the terminal. To use this profile, run
the following:

```sh
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/dotfiles/master/.zprofile" -o "$HOME/.zprofile"
```

We recommend you take a look at this file and even see if there are any
shortcuts of your own that you’d like to add!

#### Default Git Configuration File

To set up a default `.gitconfig`, run:

```sh
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/dotfiles/master/gitconfig" -o "$HOME/.gitconfig"
```

### Configure Git

With Git installed, we now want to configure it using your personal account.
First, you need to let Git know who you are. You can do this by running:

```sh
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Replacing `"you@example.com"` with the email tied to your GitHub account and
`"Your Name"` with your GitHub username. Git will use this email and name as the
author for all the changes you make.

**Recommended:** While we're configuring GitHub, we should add a new SSH key.
Setting this key up will keep you from having to provide your username
and password whenever you use the terminal to interact with GitHub.

* First, check if you already have an SSH key by running
  `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. If the terminal prints out a long string of
  characters starting with `ssh-rsa`, you've already got a string and can skip
  the next bullet
* If the last command does not print anything, run `ssh-keygen` to create a
  new SSH key. You should be prompted to select a location and passphrase for
  your new key. Leave everything blank and press enter for the default
  location and no passphrase. If you’re asked if you want to overwrite, then
  you already have an SSH key and you do not want to overwrite it.

Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` once more and copy the key that is printed out. Follow
the [instructions provided by GitHub][add ssh] and add this key to your GitHub account

#### Install Chrome

Install [Google Chrome][] and [make Chrome your default browser][default chrome].

### Install Slack

Install Slack for Mac and enable desktop notifications for Slack. One week
before your start date, you will receive an invitation to join the Flatiron
School workspace, `flatiron-school.slack.com`. You’ll also receive a welcome
email with information about channels you should join.

### Verify Installations

To verify that you've got everything installed, run the following command in
your terminal:

```sh
curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/flatiron-manual-setup-validator/master/manual-setup-check.sh | bash 2> /dev/null
```

This script will verify that everything you need is installed. If all checks pass,
you have completed the setup process and are ready to move on!
